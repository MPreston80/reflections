When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating on a project with other people who aren't necessarily
in the same area as you are.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you wouldn't want all those extra files and/or memory used on your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks clone repositories within github.  Clones copy repositories from github to your PC or on your PC.
branches are edits to your program while still maintaining the original file.
