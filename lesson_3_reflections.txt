When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating on a project with other people who aren't necessarily
in the same area as you are.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you wouldn't want all those extra files and/or memory used on your computer.
